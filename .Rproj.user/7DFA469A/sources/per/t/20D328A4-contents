```

#lets look what these other ages refer to
#raccoons become independent at 8-12 months so i'm going to categorise these 1 year olds as subadult, in the case of the >1 i think they are probably trying to imply that they are adult
#gray fox indepedent around 12 months, so i'm going to go with subadult for those too
